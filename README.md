# Survival-Game
A simple maze runner hunger game using Unreal Engine 4

# Introduction
User or player consists only **one person** and only need to use **keyboard and mouse** to play.The title for this game is **creation and destruction**.

The player is trapped in a confusing maze and must find a way out by finding a **key** hidden between the destructible mesh and need to escape with lacks of **food**. Player only need to move the character with the keyboard for walking and jumping while mouse is used to rotate camera and also the left mouse click to do the punching action.
If the player’s hunger gauge is zero, then it is game over. 

I use “W” for move forward, “S” for move backward, “A” for move to the left and “D” for right or you also can use arrow key for movement if you’re left handed. While, for the punching action you have to click on left side of the mouse, and also the mouse is used to rotate camera.
